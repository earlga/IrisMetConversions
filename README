Conversions of atmospheric quantities using Iris cubes.
These are mostly conversions of IDL scripts first developed by Dominik Brunner.

All functions are within IrisMetConversions.convert
Included functions are:

TEMPERATURE/DENSITY CONVERSIONS
theta2temp(TH, P=None, P0 = 1000.): Potential temperature to temperature
temp2theta(T, P=None, P0 = 1000.): Temperature to potential temperature
temp2tvirtual(T, MIXR=None, SH=None): Temperature to virtual temperature
theta2thvirtual(TH, MIXR=None, SH=None): Potential temperature to virtual potential temperature
rho(T, P=None, SH=0.): Air density

HUMIDITY CONVERSIONS
rh2mixr(RH, T, P=None): Relative humidity to water vapour mixing ratio
mixr2rh(MIXR, T, P=None): Water vapour mixing ratio to relative humidity
mixr2sh(MIXR): Water vapour mixing ratio to specific humidity
sh2mixr(SH): Specific humidity to water vapour mixing ratio
rh2tdew(RH, T): Relative humidity to dew point temperature
sh2tdew(SH, T, P=None): Specific humidity to dew point temperature
mixr2tdew(MIXR, T, P=None): Water vapour mixing ratio to dew point temperature
esat(T): Saturation pressure

All of the above will use the pressure coordinate of the cube if it's present and required.
